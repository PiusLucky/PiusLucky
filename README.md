### Hi there, I'm Pius Lucky 👋

## Who am I?
I specialize in the comprehensive design and development of responsive web applications, handling every aspect from database design and RESTful API implementation to crafting user interfaces.

With over four years of extensive professional experience, my skillset encompasses a wide range of technologies and languages, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery (including jQuery Ajax), Bootstrap (from version 3 to 5), Node.js, React.js, Next.js, various Object-Relational Mapping Systems (ORMs) like Sequelize and TypeORM, Vue.js (both 2 and 3), Python with Django, Flask and expertise in building RESTful web services and GraphQL APIs.

My commitment to excellence has honed my ability to maintain meticulous attention to detail and adhere to best practices in clean code development.
